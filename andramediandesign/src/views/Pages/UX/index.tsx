            Technology has played a significant role in increasing the world
            population dramatically. Consequently it has increased the level of
            the complexity of problems. However, user research methods developed
            around design frameworks can be a powerful tool to face these
            complex wicked problems. since the day I was introduced to the
            digital world, I have always been looking and thinking beyond the
            applications and platforms I have used. The temptation to find
            reliable solutions to build a better future for both humanity and
            the environment we live at.

            Currently our planet is at a critical point of animal extinction and
            bidovirsty loss. To aid in combatting this loss we have designed the
            Atmoscube. Through research conducted at the beginning of the design
            process weâ€™ve identified that people often feel unempowered in their
            ability to help the environment. To solve this problem, we have
            aimed to create an experience that informs and engages the user in
            an effort to educate and empower. Empowerment provided by
            interacting with the atomscube is designed to permeate throughout
            the users daily life, providing them with a platform to continue
            with environmentally positive life choices.
